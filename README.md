# R-beginner

Date started: 11th March 2024

I dedicate this semester of university to deepening my understanding about R and Python. You can find some projects that I have taken for offline classes such as Intro to Business Analytics, Intro to Data Science, Applied Statistics for Marketers here. Besides, these are the Coursera courses that I have used to support my study:
[Coursera R Programming by Johns Hopkins](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming)
[Coursera Data Analysis with R programming](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-analysis-r)

As for supplementary materials, I read books about consumer behavior like [호모 아딕투스 (by 김병규)](https://product.kyobobook.co.kr/detail/S000061403920), [감각을 디자인해라](https://product.kyobobook.co.kr/detail/S000000912466), [AI 2041 (by Kai-fu Lee](https://www.ai2041.com/), The materials though have nothing related to code, they help me initially brainstorm the questions that I can ask when conducting EDA and make a much sound conclusion about the dataset afterwards.
